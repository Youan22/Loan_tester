# Overview
This project is a simple interactive loan calculator implemented in Java. It prompts the user for input such as the annual interest rate, number of years, and loan amount, and calculates and displays the monthly payment, total payment, interest paid, and remaining balance of the loan.
The software is a loan calculator implemented in Java. It allows users to input the loan details such as the annual interest rate, number of years, and loan amount. The program then calculates and displays the monthly payment, total payment, interest paid, and remaining balance of the loan, providing a comprehensive overview of the loan terms. It demonstrates Java's object-oriented programming capabilities and showcases the language's ability to perform mathematical calculations and handle user input.

The purpose of writing the loan calculator software is to provide a helpful tool for individuals or businesses to calculate and understand the financial aspects of loans. This software can assist users in making informed decisions by providing them with information such as monthly payment, total payment, interest paid, and remaining balance. It can be used by financial institutions, loan officers, individuals seeking loans, or anyone interested in analyzing loan options or managing their finances.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a code walkthrough. I think the focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
